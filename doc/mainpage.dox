 * @mainpage NUGU SDK Documentation
 *
 * @section intro Introduction
 *
 * The NUGU SDK supports NUGU platform interworking on various devices and apps
 * to provide various AI functions based on voice interface.
 *
 * It sends user requests (voice commands) to the NUGU platform and
 * controls the functionality of the device or application depending on the
 * processing results of the NUGU platform.
 *
 * Since the Linux SDK is implemented based on GLib's mainloop, your
 * application should be developed in an event-driven way based on GMainLoop.
 *
 * @section overview Overview
